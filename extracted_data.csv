Buyer's Motivation: “Howard, a 2004 de novo, has experienced significant growth over the past 11 years, through consistent execution on organic growth – one customer at a time- supplemented by the execution of team lift outs in the residential mortgage arena, branch acquisitions, purchase of assets in an FDIC resolution transaction and now a traditional whole bank merger. The combination of Howard and Patapsco is, however, in and of itself, transformational and of exceptional strategic importance to us,” said Mary Ann Scully, Howard’s Chairman and CEO. “Howard has nearly tripled its asset size since its capital raise in 2012 and is now achieving the size and scale that is so important in the highly regulated and highly competitive banking industry today. It also demonstrates our disciplined ability to deploy capital quickly and in a way that supports growth both organically and by acquisition.”",3.01x,3.61x,23.00x,27.23x,,,7.47%,11.05%,83.46%,0.32%,4.24%,,,,,,13.09%,14.49%,,,,,,,,,0.04,0.93,,,-4.39%,,,,,,,,,,,"Howard Bancorp, Inc",08/31/2015,11/09/2015,10-K,03/30/2016,0001390162
